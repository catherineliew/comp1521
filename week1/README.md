# Week 1 Tutorial

Hello!

For those new to C, here are some [terminal commands](common_terminal_commands.md) and [resources/setup](c_intro.md) to refer to.

## Tips

Someone asked if I had any tips for the course. I suggest:
- Read the question/spec carefully. If stuck, read it again, as it is easy to miss something
- Ask questions on the forum and in class
- Learning to read man pages is very helpful (not so much for MIPS but for the C stuff later in the term)
- Read the course outline to get a feel for the course
- For the assignments, start early if you plan to do a lot of it
